    For this project I will create a diving logbook. When we scuba dive, we log details about the dive to help others understnad our experience and help
ourselves understand and improve our own diving capabilities. The dive log records the time underwater, amount of air used, suit used, weight used, type of air
location of the dive, visibility, and more. The project will use an array of Dive objects with properties for every aspect of the dive. Then it can use object
and array functions to interact with and display the information.
